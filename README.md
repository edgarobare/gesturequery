Project Goals
The goals of this project can be summarized as follows:

• Analyzing a collection of hand operated tools to identify their attributes not just physical but also their cultural and historical significance.

• Investigate models to represent these tools based on how they are operated and represent them using hand gestures.

• Train and recognize these gestures using a leap motion controller.

• Querying a database and matching these gestures with digitized representa- tions of these tools.

The research paper is included and titled: Using Leap Motion for Gesture-Based Querying of Cultural Assets.
